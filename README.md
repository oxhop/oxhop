Senior Software Engineer
---------------------

Started programming by learning **C/C++** in college. I used to make windows application including peer-to-peer game myself. I've got enough basic knowledges in Algorithms and Database structure. When I'm 16 yo, I'm interested in web development while participating in network related lectures. I've studied **HTML**, **CSS** and **PHP** to build a simple website hosting by **Xampp**. It was successful and became famous at school. I've built a management system for ice skating company using **CodeIgniter** and **MySQL** after graduation. I kept growing my skills by studying from **Javascript** to **Python**. Meanwhile, I mastered several frameworks including **React**, **Angular**, **Vue**, **Django**, and **Laravel**. Since 2021, I collected blockchain technologies and work on building web3 projects including **Smart Contract**, **DApp** and **Telegram bot**. In 2023, I noticed **AI/ML** technologies are becoming trending and started diving into these fields.

ü§ù¬† I'm open to collaborating on worldwide remote teams.
